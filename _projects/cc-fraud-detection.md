title: "Credit Card Fraud Detection"
excerpt: "End-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced financial dataset."
---

## Overview

This project develops a full machine learning workflow to identify fraudulent credit card transactions in a **highly imbalanced dataset (0.17% fraud rate)**.  
The pipeline includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, evaluation, and reproducibility standards suitable for real-world financial applications.

---

## Key Achievements
- Tuned **XGBoost** classifier achieving **0.98 AUC-ROC**.
- Applied advanced imbalance handling: SMOTE, class weights, undersampling.
- Implemented Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.
- Created modular, production-ready Python pipeline with logging and configs.
- Includes visualizations for ROC, PR curves, feature importance, and SHAP.
