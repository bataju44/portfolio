Hi! I am a Ph.D. in Physicist with over 4 years of hands-on experience building and validating machine learning systems for rare-event detection. Led development of ensemble pipelines (XGBoost, DNNs, BDTs), data analysis, and de- signed distributed processing workflows. Proficient in statistical analysis, model development/deployment, CI/CD automation, uncertainty quantification, and technical leadership across different functions.
