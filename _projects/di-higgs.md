title: "Di-Higgs Multilepton Analysis (ATLAS)"
excerpt: "Led multilepton Higgs boson pair analysis using ATLAS detector data; machine learning–driven signal extraction with full systematic modeling."
---

## Overview

This study aims to identify rare **Higgs boson pair production (HH → multileptons)** events using real and simulated ATLAS detector data.

As one of the core contributors, I led the multilepton channel analysis, including ML-based classification, systematic uncertainty modeling, and statistical inference.

## Key Contributions
- Engineered BDT and DNN features for signal extraction.
- Used **XGBoost, Keras, PyTorch, and TMVA** for modeling.
- Evaluated performance using **ROC/AUC, SHAP, and cross-validation**.
- Included full suite of theoretical, detector, and data-driven uncertainties.
- Contributed to **ATLAS internal notes** and **2024 JEP publication**.

## Technical Highlights
- High-performance computing: CERN Grid, SMU HPC.
- Used TREXfitter for likelihood fitting and CLs calculations.
- Managed large-scale ROOT datasets (NTuples) efficiently.
