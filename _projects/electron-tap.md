title: "Electron Identification Tag-and-Probe (ATLAS)"
excerpt: "Developed ATLAS software suite for electron efficiency measurement with systematic uncertainty integration."
---

## Overview

ATLAS uses the **Tag-and-Probe (T&P)** technique to measure electron identification and reconstruction efficiencies.  
I served as a lead developer for the electron T&P software suite, helping modernize workflows and ensure high precision.

## Key Contributions
- Implemented scalable software to process **>150 pT–η bins**.
- Integrated multiple systematic variations (PDFs, scale factors, detector effects).
- Automated plotting and efficiency calculation pipelines.
- Ensured reproducibility for collaboration-wide usage.
- Delivered publication-ready figures for efficiency curves.
